### Car Insurance
This MVC web application replicates the features of a car insurance website, allowing users to input policy details and receive a calculated quote based on business rules. It also includes an admin panel where staff can access and review all generated quotes.
### Twenty-One
This is a game based console application that simulates a game of BlackJack (also known as Twenty-One). It includes classes for cards, dealers, players, and game rules, logic such as dealing cards, calculating scores, and determining the winner.
